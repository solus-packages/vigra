        <Summary xml:lang="en">C++ library for image analysis</Summary>
        <Description xml:lang="en">VIGRA is a computer vision library that puts its main emphasis on flexible algorithms, because algorithms represent the principal know-how of this field. The library was consequently built using generic programming as introduced by Stepanov and Musser and exemplified in the C++ Standard Template Library. By writing a few adapters (image iterators and accessors) you can use VIGRA&apos;s algorithms on top of your data structures, within your environment. Alternatively, you can also use the data structures provided within VIGRA, which can be easily adapted to a wide range of applications. VIGRA&apos;s flexibility comes almost for free: Since the design uses compile-time polymorphism (templates), performance of the compiled program approaches that of a traditional, hand tuned, inflexible, solution.
